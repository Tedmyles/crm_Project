Date: 3/27/2024

Problem Statement
The Customer Relationship Management System aims to address the challenges faced by businesses in managing and organizing their interactions with customers efficiently. Traditional methods of managing customer data, such as spreadsheets or manual records, are often inefficient, error-prone, and lack scalability. Businesses need a centralized system to store customer information, track interactions, manage sales pipelines, and improve customer satisfaction.

•	User authentication and authorization to ensure secure access to the system.
•	Management of customer information, including contact details, interactions, and preferences.
•	Tracking of sales leads and opportunities through customizable pipelines.
•	Generation and tracking of quotes and invoices for sales transactions.
•	Integration with email and communication tools for seamless interaction with customers.
•	Reporting and analytics to gain insights into sales performance and customer behavior.
•	Customizable dashboards for users to monitor key metrics and activities.
